Participants are given a set of challenging coding questions to solve within a specified time limit. What makes it even more thrilling is the time penalty for incorrect answersâ€”each wrong response deducts valuable seconds from your clock. Precision and speed are key as you navigate through a series of coding challenges, making it an adrenaline-pumping test of both skill and time management. Can you beat CodeMcQuizzy? Time to code against the clock!</p>
